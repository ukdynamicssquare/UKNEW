                            <p>The basics of our ERP ROI calculator are simple. This tool considers the costs of different parameters that come under an ERP implementation and shows you the complete cost implementation. Such parameters are: </p>
                            <p><b>ERP Pricing Calculator</b> = software cost + deployment cost (cloud/on-premises) + customisation cost + number of users + types of license fees + integration cost + software training cost + post implementation support cost. </p>
                            <p>These are the background factors when it comes to calculating the price of an ERP implementation. In case you are not aware of any of these factors, the actual cost of implantation can be determined with the help of certified ERP consultants. You can contact us, discuss your business, and get the cost in no time. </p>
