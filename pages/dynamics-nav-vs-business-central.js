                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Dynamics NAV is one of the greatest ERP solutions Microsoft has ever developed. It can manage different operations while accelerating the business towards profitability. However, modern business challenges and unstable customer demands made <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-nav/"><a>Dynamics NAV</a></Link> insufficient to tackle complex business scenarios. </p>
                <p>This led Microsoft to develop a flexible and powerful ERP solution that can be personalised to meet unique business demands. Here comes Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, an upgraded version of Dynamics NAV or Navision with advanced capabilities to deal with complex business operations. </p>
                <p>Here is the real question: If NAV in an organisation is working fine, then why should someone upgrade to Business Central? </p>
                <p>If so, you need to compare the capabilities and functionalities of Dynamics NAV with Business Central to decide the best solution for your business. </p>
                <p>Maybe you are missing out on some of the advanced functions that can automate and simplify your business. Also, you might require cutting-edge technologies to supercharge your different functions. </p>
